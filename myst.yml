  title: Model of skeletal muscle cramp and its reversal
  description: >-
    We reproduce muscle cramp, as well as its prevention and reversal, by
    investigating muscle contraction and cramp, in which calcium regulatory
    networks are involved, using the extended model in comparison with the
    original model.
